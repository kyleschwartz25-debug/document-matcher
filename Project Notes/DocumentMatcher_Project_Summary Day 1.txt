Document Matcher Project: Progress Summary

1. Project Goal
- Build a Python GUI tool to compare Sales Order (SO) and Purchase Order (PO) PDFs.
- Automatically extract and compare addresses and line items.
- Provide clear, color-coded visual feedback for matches and mismatches.

2. Initial Development
- Started with a PowerShell prototype for basic PDF comparison.
- Migrated to Python for better PDF parsing and GUI capabilities.
- Chose Tkinter for the GUI and PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction.

3. Core Features Implemented
- PDF Extraction:
  - Developed a PDFExtractor class to extract raw text from PDFs.
- Address Extraction:
  - Implemented logic to parse and compare “Ship To” addresses from both SO and PO.
  - Added fuzzy matching for address fields to handle minor differences.
- Line Item Extraction:
  - Created logic to extract line items (SKU/Number, Description, Quantity) from both SO and PO.
  - Iteratively improved regex and parsing to handle real-world document quirks.

4. GUI Enhancements
- Built a Tkinter-based GUI (DocumentMatcherGUI) for user-friendly operation.
- Added file selection buttons for SO and PO PDFs.
- Displayed selected file names and status.
- Added a summary grid for address field comparison with color-coded cells (green/yellow/red).
- Added a grid for line item comparison, intended to show color-coded feedback for each item and field.

5. Comparison Logic
- Developed a DocumentMatcher class to orchestrate loading, parsing, and comparing SO and PO data.
- Implemented detailed comparison logic for both addresses and line items.
- Provided a summary of issues and a “COMPLETE MATCH” or “MISMATCH” status in the GUI.

6. Debugging and Real-World Testing
- Used debug print statements to inspect raw PDF text extraction.
- Identified that line items in both SO and PO PDFs are split across two lines in the extracted text.
- Updated extraction logic to join and parse these two-line items.
- Added more robust handling for PO line items; began similar work for SO line items.

7. Current Status
- The GUI loads, file selection works, and address comparison is robust and color-coded.
- The line item comparison grid is present but not yet populated—likely due to header detection or line joining issues in the extraction logic.
- Debugging is focused on making the SO/PO line item extraction logic reliably detect and parse all items.

8. Next Steps
- Add debug prints to confirm header detection and line buffering for SO/PO line items.
- Fine-tune regex and logic to ensure all line items are parsed and displayed in the grid.
- Validate with real-world PDFs and adjust as needed for edge cases.
- (Optional) Refactor and clean up code, add more user feedback, and improve error handling.

Version Control:
- Regular commits have been made to Git with clear messages, including WIP (Work In Progress) commits for ongoing debugging.
